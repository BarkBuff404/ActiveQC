# ActiveQC ⚙️

**ActiveQC** isn’t just code — it’s a blueprint for how **real Python should be built** when shortcuts aren't an option and duct tape won’t cut it.

Structured during an internship at **ITC Limited** under the **Industry Centre of Excellence (ICOE)**, it emphasizes:
- Ruthlessly modular architecture  
- Zero-BS plugin extensibility  
- Surgical separation of concerns  
- Type-safe, test-wrapped, future-proof design  

This isn’t a feature demo. It’s a case study in **engineering code that survives deadlines, teammates, and time**.
